## How a neutrino beam is produced in an accelerator

First, we will quickly review how neutrinos interact with other particles in the Standard Model. We will learn which physics processes are used in creating the neutrinos. We will then see how we can direct neutral particles to make a beam, how to control the energy spectrum, the flux of the beam. Lastly, we will examine the three neutrino beams: the NuMI at Fermilab, the KEK neutrino beamline, and the CNGS beam at CERN.

### Neutrino interactions

The interaction of neutrinos with other particles is completely explained in the Standard Model. Being neutral leptons, neutrinos only interact with other neutrinos of the same flavor via the Z-boson exchange (or neutral current interaction) or with a charged lepton of the same flavor via W-boson exchange (or charged current interaction). From now on, the neutral current and charged current interactions will be abbreviated as NC

before going into the details of how neutrino beam is made, we will first review important part of the Standard Model to understand the physics of the neutrino beam. 

neutrinos are neutral leptons. a peliculiar property of neutrinos is that they interact very weakly with other particles. in fact, besides the gravitational interaction, the only interaction that the particle take part in is the weak interaction.
