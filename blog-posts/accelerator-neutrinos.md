## Neutrino Oscillations with Accelerators

<!--
First, we will quickly review how neutrinos interact with other particles in the Standard Model. We will learn which physics processes are used in creating the neutrinos. We will then see how we can direct neutral particles to make a beam, how to control the energy spectrum, the flux of the beam. Lastly, we will examine the three neutrino beams: the NuMI at Fermilab, the KEK neutrino beamline, and the CNGS beam at CERN.

### Neutrino interactions

The interaction of neutrinos with other particles is completely explained in the Standard Model. Being neutral leptons, neutrinos only interact with other neutrinos of the same flavor via the Z-boson exchange (or neutral current interaction) or with a charged lepton of the same flavor via W-boson exchange (or charged current interaction). From now on, the neutral current and charged current interactions will be abbreviated as NC

before going into the details of how neutrino beam is made, we will first review important part of the Standard Model to understand the physics of the neutrino beam. 

neutrinos are neutral leptons. a peliculiar property of neutrinos is that they interact very weakly with other particles. in fact, besides the gravitational interaction, the only interaction that the particle take part in is the weak interaction.

### Why neutrinos?
Neutrinos are abundant and ubiquitous. At this very moment, they are being produced in every star, in our Sun, in our nuclear reactors, in the atmosphere above us, in the molten iron core beneath us or even in the bananas you have in the kitchen. Trillions of them passing through your body every second. And yet, they are the most mysterious ingredients among all the particles known to us today.

We learnt some crucial properties of these particles over the last 40 years. We know that there are three types of them, each dynamically linked to a charged lepton, so we name them after the corresponding charged counterpart: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos and tau neutrinos. We know pretty well the mechanisms in which they interact with other particles: the weak interaction. We know that their interactions are so weak that a single neutrino can penetrate, on average, a light year long of a lead slab before it interacts with a lead nucleus. Especially, we know that, unlike other particles, neutrinos can morph between different types in a phenomenon called neutrino oscillations. For example, after travelling some distance, a muon neutrino can turn into a tau neutrino. The phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is an evidence for non-zero masses of the particles. We built a model to explain the phenomenon and measured, to a decent degree of precision, some important parameters of this model. But that is basically all we know so far. 

There is still a great deal we do not know about the particles. What are exactly their masses and how they come about? Are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana fermions? Do neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently or in other words, what they can tell us about the CP violation? Are there any other types of neutrinos besides the three known to us? And we haven't even mentioned possible linkages of neutrino physics to the uncharted water of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, cosmic evolution, etc. Study of neutrinos can be the portal to a new physics.

I hope I convinced you that neutrino research is necessary and cool. So how are we actually doing these research? There are several approaches. Two main ones are the studies of neutrino oscillations and of neutrinoless double beta decay. With the former approach, we are currently focusing on the precision measurements of the standard three-flavour oscillations paramemters (mixing angles $\theta_{13}$, $\theta_{23}$, and mass-squared splits $\Delta m_{32}^2$ and $\Delta m_{21}^2$). These measurements are crucial in resolving the problems of CP violation in the lepton sector and of the neutrino mass ordering. This is also a good proxy to answer whether or not sterile neutrinos exist. On the other hand, neutrinoless double beta decay experiments tend determine the nature of neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana) and measure the absolute neutrino masses. If neutrinoless double beta decay can be confirmed, it would provide a direct evidence for the violation of the lepton number conservation, a long-suspected phenomenon. Eventhough the two approaches to neutrino physics research are equally exciting, for the scope of this school, we will emphasize more on the study of neutrino oscillations.

### Requirements for Neutrino Beams
 An intense source of neutrinos with well-defined momenta and energy is a must for the success of a neutrino oscillation research program. So, even though they are exceedingly abundant, no natural sources of neutrinos would make the cut for this type of study. 

 We have to make neutrino beams from particle accelerators. To this date, only a few laboratories can provide particle physicists with a neutrino beam. They are Fermilab in the US, KEK in Japan and CERN in Europe. The neutrino beamlines of all three laboratories exploits the same working principle: the muon neutrino dominated beam are created from the decay of $$\pi$$ and $$K$$ mesons.


 
 In an ideal world, we would like to have a mono-energetic, pencil neutrino beam, meaning all the neutrinos in the beam have the same energy and same direction.
