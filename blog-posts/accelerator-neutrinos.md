## Neutrino Oscillations with Accelerators

### Why neutrinos?

Neutrinos are abundant and ubiquitous. At this very moment, they are emerging from the Sun, nuclear reactors, the atmosphere above us, the molten iron core beneath us, or even the bananas you have in the kitchen. Trillions of them are passing through your body every second. And yet, they remains the most mysterious ingredients among all the particles known to us today.

We learned some crucial properties of these particles over the last 40 years. We know three types or flavors of them, each dynamically linked to a charged lepton, so we name them after the corresponding counterpart: electron neutrinos, muon neutrinos, and tau neutrinos. We know pretty well the mechanisms in which they interact with other particles: the weak interaction. We know that their interactions are so weak that a single neutrino can penetrate, on average, a light-year long of a lead slab before it knocks out a lead nucleus. Especially, we know that, unlike other particles, neutrino flavor can be altered in the so-called neutrino oscillations. For example, during a travel, a muon neutrino can turn into a tau neutrino. The phenomenon of neutrino oscillations is evidence for non-zero masses of the particles. We built a model to explain the oscillations and measured some its parameters to a decent degree of precision. But that is all, so far.

There is still a great deal that we do not know about the particles. What are precisely their masses, and how they come about? Are neutrinos Dirac or Majorana fermions? Do neutrinos and anti-neutrinos behave differently, or in other words, what can they tell us about the CP violation? Are there any different types of neutrinos besides the three known to us? And we havenâ€™t even mentioned possible linkages of neutrino physics to the uncharted water of dark matter, matter-antimatter asymmetry, cosmic evolution, etc. The study of neutrinos can be the portal to a new physics.

I hope I convinced you that neutrino research is necessary and cool. So how are we doing this research? There are several approaches. Two main ones are the studies of neutrino oscillations and neutrinoless double beta decay. With the former approach, we are currently focusing on the precision measurements of the standard three-flavor oscillations parameters (mixing angles <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta_{13}">, <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\theta_{23}">, and mass-squared splits <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta m_{32}^2"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\Delta m_{21}^2">). These measurements are crucial in resolving the CP violation problem in the lepton sector and the neutrino mass ordering. Neutrino oscillations are also an excellent proxy to answer whether or not sterile neutrinos exist. On the other hand, neutrinoless double beta decay experiments tend to determine the nature of neutrinos (Dirac or Majorana) and measure the absolute neutrino masses. If experiments confirm the neutrinoless double beta decay, it will provide direct evidence for the lepton number conservation violation, a long-suspected phenomenon. Even though the two approaches to neutrino physics research are equally exciting, we will emphasize more on the study of neutrino oscillations for the scope of this school.


### Requirements for Neutrino Beams
 An intense source of neutrinos with well-defined momenta and energy is a must for the success of a neutrino oscillation research program. So, even though they are exceedingly abundant, no natural sources of neutrinos would make the cut for this type of study. 

 We have to make neutrino beams from particle accelerators. To this date, only a few laboratories can provide particle physicists with a neutrino beam. They are Fermilab in the US, KEK in Japan and CERN in Europe. The neutrino beamlines of all three laboratories exploits the same working principle: the muon neutrino dominated beam are created from the decay of <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\pi"> and <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=K"> mesons.


 
 In an ideal world, we would like to have a mono-energetic, pencil neutrino beam, meaning all the neutrinos in the beam have the same energy and same direction.
