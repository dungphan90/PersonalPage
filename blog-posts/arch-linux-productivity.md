I'm very happy to come back after a long year. I hope to keep this blog going for longer this time. For this comeback writing, I would like to introduce a few productivity software that served me very well recently.

## VIMium 
VIMium is an open-source `google-chrome` extension that allows you to navigate the web browser with Vim key bindings. It turns `google-chrome` into a keyboard-driven software. For a long time, web browser and PDF viewer are the only too reason I keep a mouse on my desk. Now, there are websites that VIMium does not (fully) support. This issue can be easily overcome if you know the *normal* chrome key bindings (like `Alt + TAB_NUMBER`).

VIMium can be download from [Chrome Web Store]() or from the author's `github`. There are not much to config to just use the extension. The author did a good job in transfering the Vim key bindings and make them work for a web browser. Of course, there are so much flexibility if you want to tailor the keybinds to your liking, but I find I live well with what VIMium deliver by default.

### Most-used
The keybinds that I used the most with VIMium are
1. `f/F` to view all the links. If you type the follow-up letters in lowercase (no `Shift +`) then the corresponding link will be opened in the current tab, otherwise (`Shift + FOLLOW_UP`) it will be opened in a new tab, right next to the current tab.
2. `o/O` to search keywords or go to a URL. Again, just like `f/F`, the lowercase `o` will open the new website in the current tab, while the uppercase `O` will open a new tab.
