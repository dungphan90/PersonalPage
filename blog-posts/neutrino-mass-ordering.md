## Neutrino Mass Ordering Problem

Provide readers with some context here: neutrino oscillations prove that neutrinos are massive, even though their masses are tiny. The neutrino mass eigenstates are not aligned with the flavor eigenstates. The mixing of states is what led to the oscillations. We model the mixing by the PMNS matrix. So far, we measured some of the parameters in the model. Some are still not determined: neutrino mass ordering, CP violation phase, absolute neutrino mass scale, nature of neutrinos.

Briefly going over the three-flavour mixing model. Introduce the standard PMNS parameterization with 3 mixing angles, and 1 CP violation phase (2 Majonara phases are decoupled from the oscillations phenomenon). Introduced the mass-squared splitings. Mention the current status of the measurements of these parameters.

Explain the neutrino mass ordering in more details. With neutrino oscillations, we can only measure the mass-squared splitting. The sign of solar mass-squared spliting is determined, but the atmospheric mass-squared spliting is not. Why? Because, the sign is unknown, we don't know if <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu_3$$ is heavier or lighter than $$\nu_{1,2}$$. The scenario in which $$\nu_3"> is heavier than the others is refered to as the **normal hierarchy** (NH) while the opposite is called the **inverted hierarchy** (IH).

The first mass eigenstate <img src="https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu_1$$ is the one with largest electron neutrino $$\nu_e$$ component. The mass eigenstate $$\nu_3$$ is the one with smallest $$\nu_e$$ component. So in the normal hierarchy, the neutrino mass ordering resembles that of the charged leptons (that's why it is dubbed 'normal'). The inverted hierarchy introduces the opposite situation. A note on the nomenclature: many physicists argue that the 'hierarchy' in this context is misleading. After all, we don't know the absolute neutrino mass yet. It can happen that the lightest neutrino mass ($$\nu_1$$ in NH or $$\nu_3"> in IH) is in the same order of magnitude with the other two mass eigenstates (in such a case, the masses are much larger than the mass-squared splits so we have a mass degenerate situation). That means there is actually no hierarchy

## Introduction

Neutrino oscillations are well established phenomena. 

Specify some types of oscillations or link to the neutrino oscillation page.


All experimental data on neutrino oscillations is consistent with the 3-flavour mixing model. In this model, the three flavour neutrino states $$\nu_e$$, $$\nu_\mu$$, and $$\nu_\tau$$ are linear combinations of the three massive neutrino states $$\nu_1$$, $$\nu_2$$, and $$\nu_3$$. The mixing matrix, called the PMNS matrix, is parameterized by three mixing angles $$\theta_{12}$$, $$\theta_{13}$$, and $$\theta_{23}$$ and CP violation phase $$\delta_\text{CP}$$.

The oscillations probabilities depends on the mixing parameters, neutrino energy $$E$$, the travel distance $$L$$, and the mass squared differences $$\Delta m_{ij}^2$$. 

Formula here LaTeX.

Once point worth notice is that the numbering of the mass eigenstates is arbitrary. To associate the mixing angles $$\theta_{12}$$, $$\theta_{13}$$, and $$\theta_{23}$$ to the observables, it's convenient to identify the $$\Delta m_{21}^2$$ to the smaller mass squared difference that drives the oscillation of solar neutrinos and reactor antineutrinos. Again, for convenience, the convention is chosen to be $$m_1 < m_2$$ so that $$\Delta m_{21}^2 > 0$$. This choice left us with two mass ordering schemes: either $$ m_1 < m_2 < m_3$$ (normal ordering) or $$m_3 < m_1 < m_2$$ (inverted ordering). The larger mass squared difference, which drives the oscillations of atmospheric neutrinos and accelerator neutrinos, is associated with $$|\Delta m_{31}^2|$$ or $$||delta m_{32}^2|$$ (see PDG 2018, Section 14.2).
