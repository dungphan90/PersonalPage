## Renormalizability

[Taken from "The Standard Model - A Primer" by Cliff Burgess and Guy Moore.]

Physical quantum theories generally require an associated minimum distance or a maximum energy beyond which its applicability is nullified. An example is the quantum electrodynamics of electrons and photons. This theory is correct upto an energy of twice the mass of a muon: $$\Lamdba = 2m_\mu$$. At energy higher than this, muon pair-production can happen, leading to the presence of muons even if they are not present in the initial state. The correct theory for this higher energy regime becomes the quantum electrodynamics of electrons, photons and muons. In turn, this new theory will be only valid until the next energy cut-off which might be twice the mass of a pion, and so on.

This cut-off does not necessary show itself classically. However, in a quantum theory where all states can contribute to any given process as intermediate particles, the calculations will depend on the cut-off scale explicitly.
