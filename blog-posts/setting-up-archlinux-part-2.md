## Some lessons on Arch
0. Minimal good. Bloated bad. 

Now, to make everything bloated:
1. PulseAudio sucks so hard. It brings the decent GNOME-DE down to its level. Use ALSA without PulseAudio. 
2. Latest version of the kernel sucks a bit. Use LTS.
3. Updating packages everyday sucks. Do it once every few weeks instead.
4. GNOME is bloated but GNOME-minimal might not be that bad. However, awesomeWM or other tiling window manager is much better. Migrate to tiling WM for your own good. Not ready for tiling WMs yet but sick of bloated DEs, then go `openbox`. 
5. `awesome` is awesome. Check it out, you will not regret. Everything is customizable. 
6. Nothing beats `vim`. All the roads go back to `vim`. `SpaceVim` is quite good, give it a shot. Also, learn `vim` motions. Those motions make you so fast. Also, learn to type, try to reach 100wpm. Everyone can 100wpm with a few months of practice.
7. `yay` is great but no longer maintained. Move to `paru`. `pacman` is still awesome as always.
8. `zoom` is the gate to security hell. Move to `jitsi-meet` please.

## My new laptop
I used to love Macbooks. I actually had 2: a 2015 Macbook Air and a 2018 Macbook Pro 15-inch. Both works great, leaving me the impression that I will never look back to any products other than Apple's. Oh boy, I was never being more wrong in my life.

I'm not gonna try to convince you of what kind of a company Apple is. You should see it for yourself: check out Louis Rossmann's videos, check out this guy [Jeffrey Paul](https://sneak.berlin/20201112/your-computer-isnt-yours/), and [this](https://lapcatsoftware.com/articles/catalina-executables.html), and [this](https://sigpipe.macromates.com/2020/macos-catalina-slow-by-design/).

The frustration with Apple, together with the fact that I mostly work from home now and my Linux desktop became my main production machine, led me to the decision to sell my Macbooks. I bought a used HP Pavilion Gaming with some big cash on top of it. I'm more than happy with that decision.
