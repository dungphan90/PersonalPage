## Misc. tips and tricks on using SpaceVim

1. Toggle `lint` on save. The default setup for this feature is `on`, meaning that pre-compiling check will be run on save (`:w`). If you, like me, find this feature annoying, you can turn it off by set 
  ```
  let g:spacevim_lint_on_save = 0
  ```
  in `~/.SpaceVim/autoload/SpaceVim./vim`.
