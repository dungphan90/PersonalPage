## About me

Welcome to my personal webpage!

I am Dung Phan, a postdoc working in experimental high energy physics at the Department of Physics and Astronomy, University College London. My two supervisors are [Dr. Jennifer Thomas](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-jennifer-thomas) and [Dr. Ryan Nichol](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/physics-astronomy/people/professor-ryan-nichol).

I have broad interests in physics, with a particular focus on the neutron-antineutron oscillations. This phenomenon provides a close connection between particle physics and cosmological evolution. It will help us to understand the mechanism in which the Universe transits from an early state balanced between matter and antimatter to the one that we are living today in which matter dominates. The search that Iâ€™m working on uses the NOvA Far Detector. In particular, a neutron in the atomic nucleus that comprises the detector might rarely turn into an antineutron. This antineutron will immediately annihilate with one of the surrounding nucleons. This interaction leaves behind a star-like pattern of energy hits that can be recorded by the detector. My job is to develop an algorithm that continuously looks for and collect those patterns.

<!--Another research direction I'm working on is the search for sterile neutrinos in the MINOS/MINOS+ experiment. Thanks to the results of many experiments over the last 40 years, we established a fairly good understanding of the phenomenon. We learnt that neutrinos can morph between three different **flavors** as they travel. Thanks to this discovery, we know that neutrinos have masses, albeit tiny ones. We built up a model to explain all of these observations based on the mixing of neutrino flavor eigenstates and mass eigenstates. The core of this model is the mixing matrix called the [PMNS matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pontecorvo%E2%80%93Maki%E2%80%93Nakagawa%E2%80%93Sakata_matrix) (named after Bruno Pontecorvo, Ziro Maki, Masami Nakagawa, and Shoichi Sakata). Precision measurements of the parameters that characterize the PMNS matrix has been always the main themee of neutrino oscillations experiments over the years. MINOS/MINOS+ is not an exception. In fact, this experiment had, for a number of years, provided the most precise measurements of $\theta_{23}$ and $\Delta m_{32}^2$. MINOS/MINOS+ did this by measuring the...-->

Besides physics, I enjoy reading about biology, especially evolution and genetics. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games. Some of my favorite games are the Ori series, DOTA, and Zelda BOTW.
